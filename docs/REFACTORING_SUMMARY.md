# Crystal Mystery Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created YAML-Based Configuration System
- **`game_config.yaml`** - Complete game configuration including:
  - Window settings
  - Player configuration
  - Asset paths (scenes, audio, quests)
  - Feature toggles
  - Initial game state
  - UI configuration

### 2. Enhanced Engine with Missing Features
- Added `game_state_manager` and `quest_manager` properties
- Added `show_fps` property and rendering
- Added `enable_auto_save()` method with interval-based saving
- Auto-save logic in the update loop

### 3. Created Game Configuration Loader
- **`src/core/game_config.cr`** - YAML deserialization and engine setup
- Loads all assets based on glob patterns
- Configures engine features from YAML
- Sets up initial game state

### 4. Simplified Main Game File
- **`main_simple.cr`** - Reduced from ~980 lines to ~40 lines!
- Just loads YAML config and runs
- All configuration moved to `game_config.yaml`

### 5. Created Templates
- **`templates/game_config_template.yaml`** - Template for new games
- **`templates/minimal_game.cr`** - Minimal game starter (only 10 lines!)

## Before vs After

### Before (main.cr):
```crystal
# 980 lines of code including:
- Hardcoded scene creation
- Manual system initialization
- Inline interaction logic
- Mixed configuration and logic
```

### After (main_simple.cr + game_config.yaml):
```crystal
# main_simple.cr - 40 lines
config = GameConfig.from_file("game_config.yaml")
engine = config.create_engine
engine.show_main_menu
engine.run
```

```yaml
# game_config.yaml - All configuration in one place
game:
  title: "The Crystal Mystery"
window:
  width: 1024
  height: 768
# ... etc
```

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Configuration separate from code
2. **No Compilation Needed** - Change settings without recompiling
3. **Easier Modding** - Users can modify YAML files
4. **Reusable** - Same engine code for different games
5. **Cleaner Code** - 95% reduction in main file size
6. **Better Documentation** - YAML is self-documenting

## Migration Path

1. Copy `game_config.yaml` to your project
2. Customize the settings
3. Replace your main.cr with the simple version
4. Move any custom Lua functions to `register_game_functions()`
5. Test and enjoy the simplicity!

## Example: Creating a New Game

```crystal
# my_game.cr
require "../src/point_click_engine"

config = PointClickEngine::Core::GameConfig.from_file("my_game_config.yaml")
engine = config.create_engine
engine.show_main_menu
engine.run
```

That's it! The entire game setup is now data-driven through YAML.
