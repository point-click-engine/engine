# Point & Click Engine Testing Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive testing strategy for the Point & Click Engine, focusing on proactive bug discovery and quality assurance.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run the comprehensive test suite
./run.sh test-comprehensive

# Run specific test categories
./run.sh test-stress      # Stress testing only
./run.sh test-memory      # Memory-focused tests
./run.sh test-fuzz        # Fuzzing tests
./run.sh spec            # Standard unit tests
```

## Overview

Instead of fixing bugs reactively as games encounter them, this strategy proactively discovers engine issues through systematic testing. The approach combines multiple testing methodologies to ensure comprehensive coverage and reliability.

## Test Categories

### Phase 1: Standard Unit Tests
**Purpose**: Tests individual components in isolation
- Core engine functionality
- Scene management
- UI components  
- Audio systems

### Phase 2: Deep Integration Tests
**Purpose**: Tests complete game scenarios end-to-end

```crystal
# spec/integration/complete_game_spec.cr
describe "Complete Game Integration" do
  it "runs a full game lifecycle without crashes" do
    engine = create_test_engine
    
    # Test every major engine path
    test_scene_transitions(engine)
    test_input_scenarios(engine)
    test_save_load_cycles(engine)
    test_audio_systems(engine)
    test_quest_systems(engine)
    test_memory_usage(engine)
  end
end
```

### Phase 3: Property-Based Testing
**Purpose**: Uses random inputs to discover edge cases

```crystal
# spec/property/engine_properties_spec.cr
require "quick"

describe "Engine Property Tests" do
  it "scene transitions are always valid" do
    Quick.check do |scene_name, target_scene|
      engine = create_test_engine
      # Property: scene transitions should never crash
      engine.change_scene(scene_name)
      engine.change_scene(target_scene)
      engine.current_scene.should_not be_nil
    end
  end
end
```

### Phase 4: Stress Testing
**Purpose**: Tests engine under extreme conditions

```crystal
# spec/stress/engine_stress_spec.cr
describe "Engine Stress Tests" do
  it "handles rapid scene transitions" do
    engine = create_test_engine
    100.times { |i| engine.change_scene("scene#{i % 5}") }
  end
  
  it "handles memory pressure" do
    # Load/unload many assets rapidly
    # Create many objects and clean them up
    # Test garbage collection behavior
  end
  
  it "handles long-running sessions" do
    # Simulate hours of gameplay
    # Check for memory leaks
    # Verify performance doesn't degrade
  end
end
```

### Phase 5: Fuzzing Framework
**Purpose**: Discovers bugs through malformed/unexpected inputs

```crystal
# spec/fuzzing/input_fuzzer_spec.cr
describe "Input Fuzzing" do
  it "handles malformed YAML gracefully" do
    fuzz_yaml_configs.each do |config|
      result = GameConfig.from_yaml(config)
      # Should not crash, should return meaningful errors
      result.should be_a(Result)
    end
  end
  
  it "handles invalid user input" do
    engine = create_test_engine
    fuzz_user_inputs.each do |input|
      # Should not crash on any input
      expect { engine.handle_input(input) }.to_not raise_error
    end
  end
end
```

### Phase 6: Memory Safety & Leak Detection
**Purpose**: Ensures proper memory management

```crystal
# spec/memory/memory_safety_spec.cr
describe "Memory Safety" do
  it "has no memory leaks during normal operation" do
    initial_memory = get_memory_usage
    
    # Run representative game session
    simulate_gameplay_session
    
    force_gc
    final_memory = get_memory_usage
    
    # Memory should not grow unbounded
    (final_memory - initial_memory).should be < ACCEPTABLE_LEAK_THRESHOLD
  end
end
```

### Phase 7: Performance Benchmarking
**Purpose**: Detects performance regressions

```crystal
# spec/benchmarks/performance_benchmarks_spec.cr
describe "Performance Benchmarks" do
  benchmark "scene loading" do |x|
    x.report("simple scene") { load_simple_scene }
    x.report("complex scene") { load_complex_scene }
    x.report("scene transition") { scene_transition }
  end
  
  benchmark "rendering" do |x|
    x.report("basic render") { render_simple_scene }
    x.report("complex render") { render_complex_scene }
  end
end
```

### Phase 8: Edge Case Testing
**Purpose**: Tests boundary conditions and unusual scenarios

```crystal
# spec/edge_cases/boundary_conditions_spec.cr
describe "Boundary Conditions" do
  it "handles empty games" do
    # Game with no scenes, no assets
  end
  
  it "handles massive games" do
    # Game with 1000+ scenes, huge assets
  end
  
  it "handles malformed assets" do
    # Corrupted images, invalid audio files
  end
  
  it "handles resource exhaustion" do
    # Out of memory, disk full, etc.
  end
end
```

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "All tests passed - ready for release"
else
  echo "Tests failed - fix issues before merging"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Test Game Generation

### Procedural Test Games
Create games that systematically test every feature:

```crystal
# tools/test_game_generator.cr
class TestGameGenerator
  def generate_comprehensive_test
    game_configs = [
      minimal_game,          # Bare minimum viable game
      audio_heavy_game,      # Stress audio system
      dialog_intensive_game, # Complex dialog trees
      quest_complex_game,    # Multi-stage quests
      scene_transition_game, # Rapid scene changes
      memory_intensive_game  # Large asset loading
    ]
    
    game_configs.each { |config| validate_game(config) }
  end
end
```
