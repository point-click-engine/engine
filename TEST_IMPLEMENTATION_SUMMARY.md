# Test Implementation Summary

## Created Spec Files

### Core Specs
- `spec/scenes/scene_spec.cr` - Tests for Scene class
- `spec/scenes/hotspot_spec.cr` - Tests for Hotspot class  
- `spec/core/game_object_spec.cr` - Tests for GameObject base class
- `spec/characters/player_spec.cr` - Tests for Player character
- `spec/scripting/script_engine_spec.cr` - Tests for Lua scripting engine

### Integration Tests
- `spec/integration/simple_headless_test_spec.cr` - Basic headless tests
- `spec/integration/crystal_mystery_headless_spec.cr` - Headless game test (requires mocking)
- `spec/integration/crystal_mystery_visibility_spec.cr` - UI visibility tests
- `spec/integration/crystal_mystery_gameplay_spec.cr` - Full gameplay simulation

### Support Files
- `spec/support/raylib_mock.cr` - Mock Raylib for headless testing
- `run_headless_tests.sh` - Script to run all tests in headless mode

## Test Coverage Added

### Unit Tests
✅ Scene management (creation, adding hotspots/objects)
✅ Hotspot functionality (bounds, click detection)
✅ GameObject base functionality
✅ Player character basics
✅ Script engine execution
✅ Dialog system (already existed)
✅ GUI system (already existed)
✅ Achievement system (already existed)
✅ Inventory system (already existed)

### Integration Tests
✅ Engine creation without window
✅ Dialog visibility and timing
✅ Achievement unlocking flow
✅ Inventory management
✅ Scene and hotspot interaction
✅ GUI element management

### Advanced Tests (Require Full Mocking)
- Crystal Mystery game initialization
- Complete gameplay walkthrough
- UI element visibility at different game states
- Scene navigation flow

## Running Tests

### Standard Unit Tests
```bash
crystal spec
```

### Specific Test Files
```bash
crystal spec spec/scenes/scene_spec.cr
crystal spec spec/integration/simple_headless_test_spec.cr
```

### Headless Mode (with mocking)
```bash
export HEADLESS_MODE=true
./run_headless_tests.sh
```

## Notes on Headless Testing

The Crystal Mystery game tests require a more complete Raylib mock to run without a window. The mock implementation in `spec/support/raylib_mock.cr` provides:

- Window management stubs
- Input simulation
- Drawing no-ops
- Collision detection logic

For true headless testing of the full game, you would need to:
1. Set `HEADLESS_MODE=true` environment variable
2. Use the mock Raylib implementation
3. Simulate frame updates programmatically

The simple headless tests demonstrate that all engine components can be created and tested without requiring a graphical window, which is suitable for CI/CD pipelines.
