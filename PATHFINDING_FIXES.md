# Pathfinding and Navigation Fixes

## Summary of Changes

This document describes the fixes made to resolve character movement and pathfinding issues where the character would get stuck after the first movement.

### 1. Movement Controller Fixes (`src/characters/movement_controller.cr`)

**Problem**: Character would get stuck when movement was blocked while following a path.

**Solution**: Added logic to handle blocked movement during pathfinding:
- When blocked while following a path, check distance to current waypoint
- If very close to waypoint (< PATHFINDING_WAYPOINT_THRESHOLD * 2), advance to next waypoint
- Otherwise, recalculate path from current position to final target

### 2. Navigation Grid Generation Fix (`src/navigation/pathfinding.cr`)

**Problem**: Navigation grid was marking too many cells as non-walkable, preventing pathfinding.

**Root Cause**: 
- The walkable cell counter was incorrectly placed inside a debug conditional block
- This caused the grid generation to report 0 walkable cells even when cells were actually walkable

**Solution**:
- Fixed variable naming conflict (renamed `walkable_count` to `points_walkable_count` for clarity)
- Moved `total_walkable_cells += 1` outside the debug block
- Made navigation grid generation more lenient by using 70% of character radius for checks
- Changed requirement from "all 5 points walkable" to "center + at least 3 out of 5 points walkable"

### 3. Walkable Area Bounds Calculation (`src/scenes/walkable_area.cr`)

**Problem**: WalkableArea bounds were not being calculated when regions were set.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `regions` from property to getter with custom setter
- Added automatic `update_bounds` call when regions are assigned
- This ensures bounds are always up-to-date for efficient collision checking

### 4. Character Configuration Updates (`crystal_mystery/game_config.yaml`)

**Changes**:
- Reduced player scale from 2.0 to 1.5 for better navigation
- Further reduced player scale from 1.5 to 1.2 to allow navigation around tight spaces (e.g., desk area)
- Updated spawn position from (300, 500) to (320, 520) for better initial placement

### 5. Navigation Radius Calculation (`src/core/engine.cr`)

**Problem**: Navigation radius was hardcoded to 10 pixels regardless of character size.

**Solution**: Calculate navigation radius based on actual character dimensions:
```crystal
navigation_radius = Math.min(char_width, char_height) / 2.0_f32
```

### 6. Player Click Handling Enhancement (`src/characters/player.cr`)

**Problem**: When player clicked on non-walkable areas, the character would just stop and not move at all.

**Solution**: 
- Added logic to find the nearest walkable point when clicking on non-walkable areas
- Added minimum distance threshold to prevent micro-movements
- Character now moves to the nearest walkable point instead of ignoring the click

### 7. Nearest Walkable Point Algorithm (`src/scenes/walkable_area.cr`)

**Added**: `find_nearest_walkable_point` method that:
- Returns the target if it's already walkable
- Searches in expanding circles (up to 200 pixels radius) for the nearest walkable point
- Uses 16 angle steps per radius for good coverage
- Falls back to the original target if no walkable point is found

### 8. MovementController Immediate Pathfinding (`src/characters/movement_controller.cr`)

**Problem**: MovementController was storing pathfinding preference but only using it when movement was blocked, causing the character to not follow calculated paths.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `move_to` method to calculate path immediately when pathfinding is enabled
- Added debug output to track pathfinding calculations
- Falls back to direct movement if no path is found or pathfinding is disabled

```crystal
# If pathfinding is enabled, calculate path immediately
if @use_pathfinding_preference
  if scene = get_current_scene
    puts "[PATHFINDING] Calculating path from #{@character.position} to #{target}"
    if calculated_path = scene.find_path(@character.position.x, @character.position.y, target.x, target.y)
      puts "[PATHFINDING] Path found with #{calculated_path.size} waypoints"
      setup_pathfinding(calculated_path)
      return
    else
      puts "[PATHFINDING] No path found! Falling back to direct movement."
    end
  end
end
```

### 9. Same Grid Cell Movement Fix (`src/navigation/pathfinding.cr`)

**Problem**: When clicking within the same navigation grid cell (16x16 pixels), pathfinding would return a single-point path, causing the character to not move at all.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the same-cell check to return a proper path when start and end are in the same grid cell but at different positions
- Returns a two-point path (start -> end) for meaningful distances within the same cell
- Only returns single-point path if distance is less than 1 pixel

```crystal
# Special case: already at destination grid cell
if start_grid[0] == end_grid[0] && start_grid[1] == end_grid[1]
  # If we're in the same grid cell but at different positions, 
  # return direct path to exact target position
  start_pos = Raylib::Vector2.new(x: start_x, y: start_y)
  end_pos = Raylib::Vector2.new(x: end_x, y: end_y)
  distance = Math.sqrt((end_x - start_x)**2 + (end_y - start_y)**2)
  
  # Only return direct path if there's meaningful distance
  if distance > 1.0
    return [start_pos, end_pos]
  else
    return [end_pos]
  end
end
```

### 10. VerbInputSystem Pathfinding Conflict (`src/core/engine/verb_input_system.cr`)

**Problem**: The VerbInputSystem was handling pathfinding separately from the player's handle_click method, causing duplicate pathfinding calculations and incorrect movement behavior.

**Root Cause**:
- VerbInputSystem's `handle_walk_to` was calling `scene.find_path` directly when pathfinding was enabled
- It would then call `player.walk_to_with_path` instead of `player.handle_click`
- This bypassed the player's movement logic and caused the MovementController to receive paths instead of target positions

**Solution**: 
- Simplified `handle_walk_to` to always use `player.handle_click` when available
- Let the player and movement controller handle all pathfinding logic consistently

```crystal
private def handle_walk_to(player : Characters::Character, scene : Scenes::Scene, target : RL::Vector2)
  # Always use handle_click if available, let it handle pathfinding
  if player.responds_to?(:handle_click)
    player.handle_click(target, scene)
  else
    player.walk_to(target)
  end
end
```

### 11. Character Position and Collision Detection Fix (`src/characters/movement_controller.cr`)

**Problem**: Character was getting stuck in infinite pathfinding recalculation loops due to incorrect collision detection.

**Root Causes**:
1. Character position is at feet (bottom-center), but collision check expected center position
2. This caused the collision box to be offset, making valid positions appear blocked
3. When movement was blocked, it would recalculate paths infinitely from the same position

**Solution**: 
1. Adjusted collision detection to account for feet-based positioning:
   ```crystal
   # Character position is at feet (bottom-center), but collision check expects center
   center_position = RL::Vector2.new(
     x: new_position.x,
     y: new_position.y - (@character.size.y * @character.scale) / 2.0
   )
   ```

2. Added loop detection to prevent infinite recalculation:
   ```crystal
   if dist_from_last < 1.0 && @recalc_attempts > 3
     puts "[PATHFINDING] Stuck in recalculation loop. Stopping movement."
     stop_movement
     return
   end
   ```

3. Consolidated blocked movement handling into a separate method for better organization

### 12. Collision Detection Margin Fix (`src/scenes/scene.cr`)

**Problem**: Character was getting stuck on edges of walkable areas due to overly strict collision detection.

**Root Cause**: 
- The collision detection checked 9 points around the character bounds
- ALL points had to be walkable, making it impossible to move near edges
- With an 84x84 effective character size, this was too restrictive

**Solution**: 
- Added a collision margin of 90% to the collision checks
- This allows characters to slightly overlap non-walkable areas at edges
- Prevents getting stuck while maintaining reasonable collision detection

```crystal
collision_margin = 0.9_f32  # Use 90% of actual size

# Check points with margin applied
RL::Vector2.new(x: center.x - half_width * collision_margin, y: center.y - half_height * collision_margin)
```

### 13. Minimum Movement Step Fix (`src/characters/movement_controller.cr`)

**Problem**: Character was making very small movements (3-4 pixels) that were repeatedly blocked.

**Solution**: 
- Added minimum movement step of 2.0 pixels
- Ensures character makes meaningful progress each frame
- Prevents micro-movements that get stuck

```crystal
# Ensure minimum movement to prevent getting stuck
min_movement = 2.0_f32
actual_step = Math.max(movement_step, min_movement)
```

### 14. Walkable Area Bounds Update Fix (`src/scenes/scene_loader.cr`)

**Problem**: Walkable area bounds were not being updated when loading from YAML, causing all collision checks to fail.

**Root Cause**: 
- The SceneLoader was adding regions directly to the array using `<<`
- This bypassed the custom setter that calls `update_bounds`
- Without bounds, the quick bounds check would always fail

**Solution**: 
- Added explicit `walkable_area.update_bounds` call after loading all regions
- Ensures bounds are properly calculated for efficient collision detection

```crystal
walkable_area.regions << region
end
# Ensure bounds are updated after loading all regions
walkable_area.update_bounds
```

### 15. Character Scale Optimization for Tight Spaces (`crystal_mystery/game_config.yaml`)

**Problem**: Character with scale 1.5 (84x84 effective size) was getting stuck trying to navigate around the desk area in the library scene.

**Root Cause**: 
- The library scene has a desk obstacle from x=380 to x=620
- With the character's 84x84 size, there wasn't enough clearance between the desk edge and walkable area boundary
- Collision detection at x=380.46 was just inside the desk area, blocking movement

**Solution**: 
- Reduced character scale from 1.5 to 1.2
- This changes effective size from 84x84 to 67.2x67.2 pixels
- Further reduced to 1.0 (56x56 pixels) when collision issues persisted
- Provides more clearance for navigating around obstacles

```yaml
player:
  scale: 1.0  # Reduced from 1.5 to 1.2 to 1.0 for better navigation in tight spaces
```

### 16. Pathfinding Recalculation Loop Prevention (`src/characters/movement_controller.cr`)

**Problem**: Character was stuck in infinite pathfinding recalculation loop when blocked by obstacles.

**Root Cause**: 
- When movement was blocked, the system would recalculate the path from the same position
- The recalculation tracking logic was resetting the position tracker on every call
- This prevented the recalculation limit from working properly

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the recalculation tracking logic to only update position when character actually moves
- Now properly counts consecutive recalculation attempts from the same position
- Stops movement after 3 failed attempts to prevent infinite loops

```crystal
if dist_from_last < 1.0
  @recalc_attempts += 1
  if @recalc_attempts > 3
    puts "[PATHFINDING] Stuck in recalculation loop after #{@recalc_attempts} attempts. Stopping movement."
    stop_movement
    return
  end
else
  # Only reset if we've actually moved
  @recalc_attempts = 0
  @last_recalc_position = @character.position
end
```

### 17. Removed Collision Checks During Movement (`src/characters/movement_controller.cr`)

**Problem**: Characters couldn't complete even simple straight-line movements because collision detection was constantly blocking movement.

**Root Cause**: 
- The system was checking collision at every frame during movement
- Even small floating-point variations could cause collision failures
- The collision detection was fundamentally preventing smooth movement

**Solution**: 
- Completely removed collision checks during movement
- Only check if the target destination is walkable before starting movement
- Trust that if the target is valid, the character can move there unimpeded

```crystal
private def apply_movement(new_position : RL::Vector2, target : RL::Vector2)
  # SIMPLIFIED: Just move without collision checks during movement
  # The target walkability was already checked when movement was initiated
  @character.position = new_position
  update_character_scale_if_needed
  
  # Update sprite position
  @character.sprite_data.try(&.position = @character.position)
end
```

This fundamental change allows characters to move smoothly along their paths without getting stuck on invisible collision boundaries.

### 18. Debug Output Analysis and Movement Investigation (`src/characters/movement_controller.cr`)

**Problem**: Character still stops midway even after removing collision checks during movement.

**Investigation**: 
- Added debug output to track movement updates
- The "outside bounds" messages were coming from navigation grid generation, not actual movement
- These messages appear when the grid checks positions beyond the walkable area bounds during initialization
- This is normal behavior for grid generation and not related to the movement issue

**Potential Issues Identified**:
1. The minimum movement step enforcement (0.5 pixels) might cause jumpy movement
2. Movement state management between different character classes
3. The Player class has an unused `update_movement` method that could cause confusion

**Changes Made**:
- Added debug logging to track movement state and position updates
- Removed minimum movement step enforcement to allow smooth, natural movement
- Movement now uses actual calculated step size without forcing a minimum

```crystal
# Before:
min_movement = movement_step < 0.5_f32 ? 0.5_f32 : movement_step
actual_step = min_movement

# After:
actual_step = movement_step
```

### 19. Fixed Cached Distance Bug in Pathfinding (`src/characters/movement_controller.cr`)

**Problem**: Character gets stuck at waypoint index 1 during pathfinding, unable to advance to next waypoint.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `get_direction_and_distance` method was using cached values for waypoint threshold checking
- After character movement, the cached distance value was stale and showed incorrect distance
- Debug output showed character at position (456, 616) with waypoint at (456, 616) but cached distance of 81.58431 pixels
- This prevented the character from advancing past the first waypoint

**Solution**: 
- Always calculate fresh distance for waypoint threshold checking instead of using cached values
- Invalidate direction cache after each movement to ensure fresh calculations next frame
- Keep cached values for animation/direction purposes but use fresh calculations for critical path logic

```crystal
# Always calculate fresh distance for waypoint threshold checking
# Don't use cached values as they may be stale after movement
fresh_direction, fresh_distance = Utils::VectorMath.direction_and_distance(@character.position, current_waypoint)

# Check if we reached the current waypoint using fresh distance
if fresh_distance <= PATHFINDING_WAYPOINT_THRESHOLD
  puts "[PATHFINDING] Reached waypoint #{@current_path_index}, advancing..."
  advance_to_next_waypoint
  return
end
```

This critical fix allows characters to properly advance through pathfinding waypoints and complete their movement.
