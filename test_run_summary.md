# Point Click Engine Test Suite Summary

## Test Run Results

Successfully ran the test suite while excluding potentially hanging tests.

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 1302 examples
- **Passed**: 1294 tests
- **Failed**: 5 tests
- **Errors**: 0
- **Pending**: 3
- **Success Rate**: 99.6%

### Excluded Tests
The following categories of tests were excluded to prevent hangs:

1. **Integration Tests** (that open Raylib windows):
   - render_system_integration_spec.cr
   - simple_engine_integration_spec.cr
   - coordinate_system_consistency_spec.cr
   - ui_fixes_integration_spec.cr
   - player_visibility_test_spec.cr
   - door_transition_spec.cr

2. **Performance/Stress Tests**:
   - engine_stress_spec.cr
   - performance_regression_spec.cr
   - memory_leak_spec.cr

3. **Rendering Tests**:
   - engine_render_integration_spec.cr
   - engine_integration_spec.cr
   - engine_manager_integration_spec.cr
   - rendering_comprehensive_spec.cr
   - simple_headless_test_spec.cr

4. **Other**:
   - config_fuzzing_spec.cr
   - archive_integration_spec.cr

### Failed Tests

1. **Movement Controller Animation Tests** (2 failures):
   - `sets walking animation when moving right` - Expected "walk_right" but got "idle"
   - `sets walking animation when moving left` - Expected "walk_left" but got "idle"

2. **Transition Duration Tests** (2 failures):
   - `Door Interaction System` - Expected duration 1.0 but got -1.0
   - `TransitionHelper parse_transition_command` - Expected duration 1.0 but got -1.0

3. **Scene Validator Test** (1 failure):
   - `validates hotspots` - Expected validation error for invalid hotspot type

### Recommendations

1. The animation failures suggest an issue with the movement animation system not properly switching from idle to walking animations.

2. The transition duration failures indicate a default value of -1.0 is being returned instead of the expected 1.0, possibly related to recent transition system changes.

3. The scene validator test failure suggests the validator might not be checking hotspot types correctly.

### Running Tests Safely

To run the safe subset of tests, use the provided script:
```bash
./run_safe_tests.sh
```

This script automatically excludes tests that:
- Open Raylib windows
- Perform stress testing
- May take excessive time
- Require full engine initialization

The excluded tests should be run separately in a controlled environment where window creation and longer execution times are acceptable.
