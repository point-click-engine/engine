2. **Expand hotspot specs** - Added comprehensive tests for all hotspot functionality
3. **Implement audio integration in animation system** - Sound effects now play through audio manager
4. **Implement smooth turn animations** - Added clockwise/counter-clockwise turn detection
5. **Integrate dialog trees with script engine** - Implemented condition checking and action execution for dialog choices
6. **Implement character dialog system integration** - Connected character interactions to dialog trees
7. **Implement table parsing in script engine** - Added Lua table parsing for dialog choices and complex data
8. **Implement save info display in menu** - Shows save timestamp, scene name, and play time in save/load menus

## In Progress ðŸš§

None currently

## Remaining Tasks ðŸ“‹

### High Priority ðŸ”´

1. **Expand engine specs**
   - Add tests for input handling
   - Add tests for scene management
   - Add tests for dialog system
   - Add tests for save/load functionality

### Low Priority ðŸŸ¢

3. **Implement remaining transition effects**
    - Currently only fade is implemented
    - Need to add slide, zoom, dissolve effects

## Code Locations

- Engine RenderManager integration: `src/core/engine.cr` (line 809)
- Transition effects: `src/graphics/transitions/transition_manager.cr` (line 179)

## Notes

- Many of these TODOs involve integrating existing systems together
- The new InputManager and RenderManager APIs are already implemented but not fully integrated
- Test coverage needs significant expansion, especially for core engine functionality
