## üöÄ Getting Started

To continue the refactoring work:

1. **Choose a file to refactor** based on priority (Menu System recommended)
2. **Follow the established patterns** from completed refactoring
3. **Create comprehensive specs** for each extracted component
4. **Validate integration** with existing systems
5. **Update documentation** and examples

The patterns and approaches established in the completed refactoring work provide a proven template for the remaining files. Each extraction should follow similar principles of component isolation, comprehensive testing, and integration validation.

## üìö Reference Materials

- **Completed Examples**: See `docs/developer-guide/REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`
- **Testing Patterns**: Review existing spec files for testing approaches
- **Component Architecture**: Study `character_refactored.cr` for integration patterns
- **Documentation Standards**: Follow existing component documentation style
